        <h3>Welcome to Tutoring Joy</h3>
        <p>
          We are Tutoring Joy, a tutoring group with an aim towards helping kids
          excel academically. We provide extra support for children who are
          struggling with class content, and are struggling to get the
          assistance that they need from their schools. We are also here for
          those who desire some additional curricular input outside of school
          hours.

        <h3>Our Offered Packages</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            We have a very wide selection of different packages. We offer
            tutoring coming in one-on-one sessions or group sessions, with no
            more than 8 pupils in a group. One-on-one tuition is done at the
            home of the pupil, with the express presence of at least one
            guardian/responsible adult. Our group sessions are normally held in
            hired rooms from various venues, which would be confirmed upon
            booking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our tutoring is perfect for children of primary and high school,
            ranging from ages 5-16. We offer assistance in academic work,
            homework, and giving extra academic support for children who
            struggle with things learned in class. We also offer special
            packages to help with SATs and GCSE preparation for those pupils
            sitting these exams.
