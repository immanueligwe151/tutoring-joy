      <h3>Welcome to Tutoring Joy</h3>
      <p>
        We are Tutoring Joy, a tutoring group with an aim towards helping kids
        excel academically. We provide extra support for children who are
        struggling with class content, and are struggling to get the assistance
        that they need from their schools. We are also here for those who desire
        some additional curricular input outside of school hours.
